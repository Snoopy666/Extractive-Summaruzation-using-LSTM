# Extractive-Summaruzation-using-LSTM
Our implementation is based on Tensorflow implementation of SummaRuNNer 
https://github.com/pocheyeniu/SummaRuNNer 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04230.pdf
We provide two data readers and models for different data preprocessing strategies and model architectures. We also provides a
predict.py file for large-scale batch predicting on distributed system in the inference process.
